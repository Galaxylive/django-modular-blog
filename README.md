# django-modular-blog-api

Component based blog API powered by django.

## Motivation

In my search for open source blog software, I didn't run into any that separates
the backend from the frontend.

I wanted to build a simple blog engine where each post consists of fragments. In
this system, blog post becomes a collection of ordered fragments. The fragments
can be of many types - plain text, HTML, markdown, an image, some code.

You should be able to build your own beautiful UI on top of it.
